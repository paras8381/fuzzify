# fuzzify
A complete Python implementation of a privacy-preserving federated learning framework for smart grid fault detection using ANFIS-like models. Simulates five edge nodes with synthetic data, fuzzy logic preprocessing, federated training, and fault-based load redistribution. Developed for academic research using Google Colab.
